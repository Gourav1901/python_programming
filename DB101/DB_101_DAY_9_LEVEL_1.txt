What is a NoSQL Database, and explain the types of NoSQL database?
ANS. Defination :
NoSQL databases (aka "not only SQL") are non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables.
NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model.
Types
Key-value pair - simpler type of database where each item contains keys and values.
Document-oriented - store data in documents similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects.
Column-oriented - store data in tables, rows, and dynamic columns.
Graph-based - store data in nodes and edges.
Example:
MongoDB : A document-oriented database, is a popular NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas.
Cassandra : Optimized for handling large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure.
Redis : An in-memory key-value store known for its speed and often used as a caching layer.
