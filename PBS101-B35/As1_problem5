### Problem Description

<!-- You are given two numbers, stored in variables with the names `fuel` and `distance`. You must calculate the value of `required`, determined by the product of `fuel` and `distance`. If `required` is greater than 50, the output should indicate that you have enough fuel, otherwise, you should continue the journey. -->


Algorithm to to claulate  the value of `required`, determined by the product of `fuel` and `distance`.
input = two variables fuel and distance
output: A string based on the value of required
Begin:Calculate the value of required 
      required  = fuel * distance
      Check if the requred is greater than 50 
      if required > 50 
      print("Enough")
      else:
      print("Go On")
end
