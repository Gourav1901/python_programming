<!-- You are given two numbers representing `distance` and `time`. You need to calculate the `speed` using the formula `speed = distance/time` and determine whether to apply brakes or keep going based on the speed. -->

Psuedo Code
Algorithm to to claulate speed of the car and determine whether to apply brakes or keep going based on the speed.
input: two variable distance and time:
output: A string based on the condition

begin: Calculate the speed with the help of distance and time
       speed = distance / time
       Check if the speed of car is above 40 or not
       if speed > 40
       print("apply brakes")
       else 
       print("Keep going")
end
