### Problem Description

<!-- Write the Psuedocode for below :

You are given a number, stored in a variable named `N`. Your task is to determine whether `N` is divisible by 3. A number that is divisible by 3 will be evenly divisible, meaning no remainder or fractional part after division. -->

Psuedo Code:
Algorithm to check if a given number is divisible by 3 or not
input: One  variable N
output: Yes or No Based on given condition

begin:Check a number if it is completely  divisible by 3 or not
      if N % 3 == 0:
      print("Yes")
      else:
      print("No")
end
